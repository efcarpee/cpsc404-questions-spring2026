## Question

This chapter is about managing the "Game of School" which is about what it takes to best answer questions. This depends on understanding what you're aware of and what your manager is expecting in an answer. We need to understand the best way to translate answers and meet expectations in a way that puts us at an advantage. 

Being on a team, especially as a new hire, means having at least one manager. In meetings/situations where I'm being ask questions not only by my manager but maybe their manager or partner who has a different area of expertise and priorities I feel inclined to answer best for my direct manager. On the other hand, there are cases where I could go beyond and look good in front of a greater audience. How should I be prioritizing these scenarios?

# Week 3 – HYBHY Chapter 2: Giving Good-Enough Answers

**Author:** Hamim Mahdie

## Question

Chapter 2 introduces the idea of “good-enough answers,” contrasting the expectations in school vs professional environments. The author suggests that managers often value timely, directionally correct responses over technically perfect ones.

In what situations might giving a “good-enough” answer strengthen trust with a manager, and when might it risk long-term technical debt or misaligned expectations? Is it unfair to expect that your manager should have context regarding what is being discussed?

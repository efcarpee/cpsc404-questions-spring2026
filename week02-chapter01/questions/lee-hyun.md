# Week 2 Question - Chapter 1: Making Inevitable Conflict Productive

**Student:** Hyun Lee

## Question
In this book, Prof. Ken positions money at the 'Safety' level of Maslow's Hierarchy, implying that satisfying this need allows professionals to ascend toward 'Self-Actualization.'

However, I see a potential paradox: Does satisfying the 'Safety' need too well (e.g., the "Golden Handcuffs" of high compensation) actually prevent this ascent?

If a developer is too afraid to lose their high salary, they may become a "yes-man" rather than engaging in the "productive conflict" or "push back" that the author defines as essential. My question is: Does an excess of financial safety ironically make "Constructive Loyalty" impossible, trapping us in a state of profitable but passive compliance?

## Context (optional)

While reading Chapter 1, I attempted to synthesize Maslow's model with the author's core argument about relationship building. The text suggests we should view conflict as a "feature, not a bug." However, real-world economics often stifle this feature. I want to discuss if the comfort of the "Safety" level acts as a ceiling rather than a foundation in the tech industry, causing us to sacrifice our professional 'Esteem' and autonomy in exchange for financial security.

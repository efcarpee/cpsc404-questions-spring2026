# Week 2 Question - Chapter 1: Making Inevitable Conflict Productive

## Question

Regardless of the quality of the manager, but especially under bad ones, what responsibility do you feel employees have in looking out for each other and ensuring that progress in climbing the heirarchy of needs is collective, not isolated?

## Context

This chapter addresses the process of conflict resolution almost as the quest of a savvy lone ranger. I imagine that you and your colleagues' goals are alligned similarly to how the manager and company's goals are closely alligned.

I recognize that this introduces a preverbial layer of complexity in terms of opening up scenarios for personalities and egos to clash, but I see this as a risk worth taking. Even from a managerial perspective, a team that is unified and on the same page is likely to perform better, which is ultimately good for the manager.

I also feel I should mention that I do recognize that this may very well open up a socioeconomic conversation about unionization (or the lack thereof), which as productive as it may be, is not my intent regarding the scope of this seminar.

**Student:** Eleanor Burke 
**Date:** 01/27/26

## Question

In the first chapter, you define a working professional as "someone who cares more about the technical details of their job than simply making another dollar for the company" (9.) How can someone make a transition (or balance) from working for the money to a 'working professional,' even if money is a priority in their life at that time?

## Context (Optional)

Directly out of college, many graduates experience a tight budget/ stress about money. This could be due to student loans, low savings, or just living on their own for the first time. When money is tight, workers don't necessarily not care about the tehnical details, but they do need to balance the need for money and the passion for their work.

## Question
Can the agendas of the Employee and Manager ever be truly aligned or is the relationship always transactional?



## Context 
Employees and managers obtain different agendas due to their position authority. Often a conflict arises, which is a disagreement that manifested due to different wants and needs from the manager and employee. The employee might want to take a different direction but will not be able to, as managers are decision-makers while employees (professionals) are advisers. Furthermore, when conflict happens, many people think they have two options which is to comply or leave and neither option actually helps you get what you want long-term. 

If the employee is not following orders, they can be replaced, and one thing the reading was discussing was how a junior new hire can be trained to bring business value, and is more likely to go with the managers orders, and ultimilately be your replacement. 

Although with differing agendas, productivity can occur in the overlap of our agendas.

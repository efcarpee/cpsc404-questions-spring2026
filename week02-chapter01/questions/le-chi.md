## Question

The chapter suggests that "great" managers rarely stay in one place for long, often moving up or on to new roles (p12), while also emphasizing the importance of building long-term constructive loyalty with a manager (p5). Adapting to a new environment takes time, and managers frequently lack complete information when making decisions (p13). How can "great" managers remain “great” while constantly moving? And given that "great" managers frequently change roles and must repeatedly adapt to new teams and environments, often without having complete information, how realistic is it for employees to rely on long-term loyalty as a strategy?

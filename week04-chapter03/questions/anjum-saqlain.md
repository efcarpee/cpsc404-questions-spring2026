## Question

Chapter 3 argues that “constructive loyalty” is built through trust and reliability, especially by not undermining your manager publicly and by helping them navigate uncertainty and organizational pressure. But where is the line between constructive loyalty and unhealthy loyalty when your manager’s fear or incentives push decisions that harm the team or your growth? What does it look like to protect the relationship and still challenge bad direction in a way that actually strengthens trust rather than eroding it?

## Question

In “What Managers Need From Us”, you say that “A good trusting relationship means we’ll also tell managers when problems arise” and that “it is important to admit when you’ve encountered problems you don’t know how to solve.” From this section, it is obviously very important to keep a good trusting relationship with your manager. However, when a problem you don’t know how to solve arises, when is it appropriate to tell your manager this? When could you have potentially not done enough to look into and solve the problem, and when does your manager know you’ve done all you can do?

## Context (optional)

In any environment with some sort of hierarchy, nobody wants to have to tell a higher up that they can’t solve a problem. However, people don’t want to seem incompetent when they do report a problem they can’t solve. In the case of the business world, you wouldn’t want to make your manager think less about your ability or have less trust in you.
